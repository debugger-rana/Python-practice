In Python, the __name__ variable is a special built-in variable that indicates the name of the module currently being executed. It helps determine whether a module is being run as the main program or being imported into another module. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation:

When a module is run directly:

The __name__ variable is set to "__main__".
This allows you to write code that only runs when the module is executed directly, not when it is imported.
When a module is imported:

The __name__ variable is set to the module's name.
This prevents certain code from running when the module is imported.
eg:-
# my_module.py

def main():
    print("This is the main function.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

#Why is it helpfull-
if  you are writting a python code ,and thier ia particular thing which you want to show to the user then we write this code 
with this condiyion:(if _name_ == "_main_":main())
