# ch=input('enter a character: ')
# # because input wil take string too and to limmit it their we have limit it to just the first char of the whole string. Thus getting char out of the string
# print(ch[0])

# # now input will get full string but still will assign the first character
# ch=input('enter a character: ')[0]
# print(ch)

# eval :- will evaluat the result
# reslut=eval(input('enter an expression: '))
# print(reslut)
